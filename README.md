## Project Description

This project arose from the problem within the International Student Leader group. There are many events happening within the international department that needs lots of plannings and meetings done, so I want to create an app/website that allows me to organize what's happening in the our group efficiently.
- Users are able to sign-up, login, and logout of the app.
- Users can cutomize their own profile (?)
- Users can see groups that they are part of, whether it is a casual friend group or leaders group.
- Within each group, they can see name, details, and date of the events that are happening.
- Each user is allowed to vote for days that they are free to participate in the events.
- Users can create groups, and admin of the group are allowed to make changes or add events.

## Project Details

This is a digital media and database project for **NCEA Level 3**, assessed against standards [91902](docs/as91902.pdf) and [91903](docs/as91903.pdf).

The project is a web app that uses [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) for the server back-end, connecting to a SQLite database. The final deployment of the app is on [Render](https://render.com/), with the database hosted at [Turso](https://turso.tech/).

The app uses [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/templates/) templating for structuring pages and data, and [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/) as the starting point for styling the web front-end.

The project demonstrates a number of **complex database techniques**:
- Structuring the data using multiple tables
- Creating queries which insert, update or delete to modify data
- Creating customised data displays from multiple tables (e.g. web pages)
- Dynamically linking data between the database and a front-end display
- Applying data access permissions as appropriate to the outcome

The project demonstrates a number of **complex digital media (web) techniques**:
- Using non-core functionality
- Using sophisticated digital effects
- Applying industry standards or guidelines
- Using responsive design for use on multiple devices
- The integration of original media assets
- Using dynamic data handling and interactivity
- Automation through scripts
