## Project Description

This project arose from the problem within the International Student Leader group. There are many events happening within the international department that needs lots of plannings and meetings done, so I want to create an app/website that allows me to organize what's happening in the our group efficiently.
- Users are able to sign-up, login, and logout of the app.
- Users can cutomize their own profile (?)
- Users can see groups that they are part of, whether it is a casual friend group or leaders group.
- Within each group, they can see name, details, and date of the events that are happening.
- Each user is allowed to vote for days that they are free to participate in the events.
- Users can create groups, and admin of the group are allowed to make changes or add events.
