## Addressing Relevant Implications

### Functionality implication

I have input fake data to tested the website consistently. Showing that all the functionality of the website works can also be seen in sprint 3, where I show the functionality of all the features on my website.


### Usability implication

For example, I remove the "view" button if that event does not have any details, this is to prevent the user from being to taken to that page and not seeing anything. The menu on each page also allows the user to access the tools easily.


### Aesthetic implication

The design of each page are quite consistent. There are contrast in colors used on the website. I have also used icons on the website to represent some things, ensure that there are spaces between buttons or content, headers are bolder than other text etc.


### End-user implication

From the prototyping of the website to the refinement, my end-user was involved. I asked for their feedback to improve the color, layout of components as well as some stuff I should consider (like how they prefer the code rather than inviting people to the group).


### Accessibility implication

I had a sign-up option for user who does not have the account, and I use the phone screen as a base while designing the website.

## Overall Review
- What went well? - Basic features work fine and turned out really well. These were done quickly. The layotu and color of the website is quite aesthetic in my opinion, but also meet the end-user's expectation.
- What didn't go so well? - One of the main purpose of this app was to allow users to vote for when they are free. However, this got complicated very easily and due to lack of time, I was not able to make this feature work. So, the user can only see details/description of the event and the date it is happening.
- How did the testing/trialling impact the final system? - Testing helped me to check for any mistake or falws on the website. It also helped me to keep track of where I am at, which feature is working and which is not, and prioritize working on parts of the website.
- What would you do differently if you could? - The styling of the website haven't quite match the design yet, so I would love to improve on that. Also, I have spent quite a bit of time on the voting feature before realising that it was jnot going to work. I should hvae thought about it more thoroughly or decided earlier to not keep the feature, so I would have had more time to do other things.
