# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

There are many events happening within the international department, so we international leaders have to meet up to brainstorm ideas and help orgainizing events. However, it is very difficult to find out which day or time people are free for a meeting, and get very confusing when communicating via instagram chat (like having to scroll through chat or creating a poll).


## End-User Requirements

The product is for a group of international student leaders, so it must be easy to use, does not require much time to complete something within the app, has a simple user interface.


## Proposed Solution

I want to create an app/website that allows me to organize what's happening in the our group efficiently.
- Users are able to sign-up, login, and logout of the app.
- Users can cutomize their own profile (?)
- Users can see groups that they are part of, whether it is a casual friend group or leaders group.
- Within each group, they can see name, details, and date of the events that are happening.
- Each user is allowed to vote for days that they are free to participate in the events.
- Users can create groups, and admin of the group are allowed to make changes or add events.

# Relevant Implications

## Functionality implication

It is related to how well my website works and whether it meets the end-user requirement.

### Relevance to the System

If the website is not functional, then the user will not be able to create task, groups or vote for when they are free. This does not solve the problem I have identified.

### Impact / Considerations

I must check the funtionality of the website regularly. This can be done by inputting fake data into the database or completing the form to see if it is shown on the website or try enter a group code to see if I am able to join the group. My final test for functionality should include trialing and testing every steps of using the website.



## Usability implication

This implication determines whether the website is easy to use for the end-users, and get things they want to do on the website done quickly.

### Relevance to the System

The website is a planning website, which means the user should not be spending a long time on the website. They should be able to quickly uand easily use the website, otherwise this will no solve the problem occuring as it might take longer time than just chatting and figuring out when people are free.

### Impact / Considerations

I will need a strong feedback from my end-user by letting them use my website. I have to consider whether users are tapping on too many buttons before they can complete each step and ensure that the UI is quick and easy to use (consider using icons that match system and the real world so they understand thesystem quicker).


## Aesthetic implication

It relates to the appearance/design of the website.

### Relevance to the System

The aesthetic is what users see, so it can either attract the user to use the website or make them feel uncomfortable if this is not done considerately.

### Impact / Considerations

End-user feedback will be crucial, as they are the people using the website. The layout, colors and text font are things that need to be considered carefully to ensure that the user feels comfortable using the website.


## End-user implication

The implication ensures that the website created meets the end-users purpose.

### Relevance to the System

The website is mainly created to solve the problem from the users, so if it does not meet the end-user implication, the website is useless.

### Impact / Considerations

I have to keep in mind while creating the website what the purpose is. Users feedback is needed to see whether there are my website has anything that is redundant/does not meet the requirement.

## Accessibility implication

This involve ensuring that all end-users are able to access the app/website.

### Relevance to the System

For the user to be able to use the website, they should be able to access it. So this implication is important for my users. Users should be able to access it even if they haven't already had an account.


### Impact / Considerations

Users should be able access my website through any devices. Mobile phone is used the most within my user group and it tends to be the most convenient device. So, my first priority is to make sure that users are able to access website through their phones, then later extend it to desktop or ipad.

# User Experience (UX) Principles

## Findable

System should be easy to navigate through, so users can find content they need. 

### Relevance to the System

This reduces the time users need to spend on the app, reduces confusion and gives users a better experience using the website. 

### Impact / Considerations

 I should consider using icons like a door for log-out or a plus sign for adding groups/events. This will help users recognize the content they are looking for quicker. 


## Contrast

There is a contrast between content on the page, especially things like background color and text color.

### Relevance to the System

A nice contrast on the website can improve users’ experience when using the website as it can invoke their emotions. If, for example, the font color blends it with the background color, users will find it hard to read the content and leave the site immediately because their eyes become uncomfortable.

### Impact / Considerations

The main color for my user’s interface is blue, so I have to make sure that I use different shades of blue for different parts. This is especially with the text and the background color. If my background color is a light color, then my text color must be in a dark color or vice versa. 


## Consistency

The system is consistent with other systems that the users have used before. 

### Relevance to the System

It relates to the user’s emotion and familiarity with the website. It can make users feel more comfortable using the website and know how to navigate through the website quickly. 

### Impact / Considerations

I must keep the layout simple and use icons that are commonly used, make sense, and can be seen on other sites. The design for each page should be similar and appear the same regardless of the devices the users use to access.
